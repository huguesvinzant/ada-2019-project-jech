      <h2 class="Title">Where is the food in Chicago?</h2>

      <p> Chicago is the third largest city in the US, counting about <b>2.7 million inhabitants</b>. It is surrounded by a large metropolitan area with a total of 10 million people, so largely surpassing the whole population of Switzerland. In addition, the Chicagoans, as the residents are called, welcome an impressive 58 million tourists each year that are willing to visit the windy city located on the shores of Lake Michigan. It is not surprising that such a megacity also offers an <b>incredibly varied and rich food scene</b> with cuisine styles from every corner of the world. An in-depth analysis of Yelp reviews and food inspection results from the Chicago Department of Public Health’s Food Protection Program will help you make your food choice! This analysis takes into account 8'647 food establishments in the city. Since Chicago has <b>77 different neighbourhoods</b>, also known as community areas, you may also want to choose your destination based on the analysis of crime rates in each of these areas. Certain destinations are better suited for families, and allow a better feeling of safety.
      </p>

      <p> To get a first feel for the food options in the city, it is valuable to know where the big food hubs are. On the interactive map, you can quickly identify the areas that will offer the greatest selection of restaurants. By zooming in, you can see in greater detail the distribution of restaurants in a specific area. In this plot you can specifically see that the highest restaurant density is located around the Chicago Loop, the heart of the city. </p>

    <!-- History -->
    <div class="Part2">
      <h2 class="Title">Food Inspection evolution</h2>

      <p> Regular food inspection procedures by the local authorities are key to ensure the safety of the clients. Chicago Department of Public Health has an elaborate procedure in place that entails the science-based inspection of all food establishments in order to protect public health. Any establishment that sells food or drinks is subject to these inspections: this ranges from restaurants, bakeries, to hospitals and schools, just to name a few. However, for the sake of this analysis, only establishments that prepare, and serve food/drinks as fundamental activity were included in this analysis (thus excluding schools, grocery stores, etc.). </p>

      <p> Establishments have a varying risk to public health, and thus inspections occur more or less frequently depending on their risk category. The risk category of an establishment will depend on the selling of risky foods, compliance history of the establishment, and the facility type. Risk 1 establishments are inspected at least twice per calendar year (accounting for 73% of establishments); Risk 2 establishments are inspected at least once per calendar year (23%); and Risk 3 establishments are inspected every two years (3.7%). </p>

      <p> By the means of a <b>Health Code Violations</b>, which is a list containing dozens of potential health hazards present in a food establishment, the inspection can lead to a  <b>pass, pass with conditions, or fail</b> result.
        The Health Code Violations before the 1st of July 2018 were categorized into critical, serious, and minor violations:
        <ul>
          <li> Example of a <b>critical violation</b>: “All food shall be from sources approved by health authorities and safe for human consumption.” </li>
          <li> Example of a <b>serious violation</b>: “Dishes and other utensils shall be rinsed or scraped to remove gross food particles and other soil before washing.” </li>
          <li> Example of a <b>minor violation</b>: “Soiled and clean linens, coats, and aprons shall be properly stored.” </li>
        </ul>
        Thus, if an inspection only led to the discovery of minor violations or none, the result would be a <b>pass</b>. However, if there were serious or critical violations, but these were corrected during inspection, this leads to a <b>pass with conditions</b>. Otherwise, this leads to the <b>failure</b> of the inspection, which must be corrected for as desired by the Department of Public Health.
        As of the 1st of July 2018, the number of violations on the list increased from 45 to 63 to better account for food safety. </p>

        </object>

        <p> If you paid close attention, you might have detected the distinct change in inspection scores happening in summer 2018. This is due to a change in the Health Code Violations. This change led to an increase in the number of possible violations of an establishment during an inspection. This change especially increased the number of critical/serious violations, and thus the number of inspection results with pass with conditions increased. </p>

        <p> Evidently, such an animated plot does not give a clear quantitative idea about the changes in the results and inspection types that occured over the past 10 years. When inspecting the results, we can again see a clear change happening after 2017. Clicking on the legend items on the right will allow you to inspect the individual changes in greater detail. </p>

        <p> Inspections can be of several types, for instance:
          <ul>
            <li> <b>‘Canvass’</b>: a regular inspection that is proportional to the risk category of the establishment. </li>
            <li> <b>‘Complaint’/’Suspect food poisoning’</b>: an inspection done in response to a complaint against the establishment by a client. </li>
            <li> <b>‘Re-inspections’</b> types take place for most of the complaint inspections. </li>
            <li>Other types such as <b>‘license’</b> (the establishment getting its license) or <b>‘consultation’</b> (the opening of the establishment) also occur. </li>
          </ul>
          The plot shows the evolution of the ratio of inspection types per year. A clear majority of the ratio of the inspections are linked to the <b>‘Canvass’</b> type, the normal regular inspections. The ratio of <b>‘Complaint’</b> inspections seems to have remained relatively stable over time, as well as the <b>‘license’</b> and <b>‘consultation’</b> inspections. The <b>‘Other’</b> inspections include ….. and have decreased over time.

        <h3 class="Title">Inspection score</h3>

        <p> To evaluate the performance of each individual establishment with respect to their inspection results, a score will be obtained from the list of violations that were committed. The minor violations do not affect the result of an inspection as defined by the Department of Public Health. They are of negligible importance compared to the serious or critical violations that are more likely to have repercussions on the health of the client. Thus, the minor violations will be omitted during the development of the score. Since both critical and serious can lead to failure, these are first combined and counted for each inspection. The final Food Inspection Score reflects the general health safety of the establishment and ranges from 0-10. Similarly to Yelp, a bigger score means better. </p>

        <p> In the map below, the average food inspection score of each community area is plotted as a heatmap that changes over the years. </p>

        <h3 class="Title">What about food chains?</h3>

        <p> When thinking about the food America offers, many Europeans will think of large fast food chains such as Burger King, McDonald’s or Starbucks. Analyzing the nine largest food chains established in Chicago, we can see that not all chains treat the food safety with the same degree of seriousness. Over the last 10 years, Starbucks emerges as the winner by passing 78% of its inspections without any serious or critical violations. However, since Starbucks is mainly a coffee chain and does not offer freshly cooked food onsite, this is not a big surprise. The award for being the least hygienic food chain in Chicago goes to Papa John’s Pizza with a staggering 3 in 10 failed inspections. Looking at the normalized cumulative failure rate over the years, some very interesting patterns emerge. Again, Papa John’s Pizza, which opened its first businesses in 2010 in Chicago, performs the worst. Other well-established chains such as McDonald’s or Subway have quite stable inspection outcomes over the years, which can be attributed to their highly standardized procedures for each branch.

        <h2 class="Title">Yelp ratings</h2>

        <p> Yelp.com is a website that helps people find great local businesses such as restaurants based on customer reviews. Each establishment has a page where visitors can write comments and add a general score reflecting their experience. The same restaurants that were previously analyzed with the Chicago Food Inspection results are analyzed below with their Yelp score. A score on Yelp ranges from 0-5, where 0 is the lowest grade and 5 the highest. </p>

        <p> The dual map below shows the rating of the 100 restaurants with the most reviews on the left, and the score of the 100 restaurants with the least reviews on the right. Each establishment is a pin on the map (with a restaurant symbol) and their color reflects the score they have on Yelp. </p>

        <object width="1000" height="500" align="middle" data="site/img/dual.html">
          Your browser doesn’t support the object tag.
        </object>

        <p> Interestingly, it can be noted that the restaurants with the most reviews have better ratings (a grade of 3 or higher) than the restaurants with less reviews. Also, the establishment with more reviews are located much closer to the city-center. Thus, the popularity and success of a restaurant seems to be reflected by the number of reviews, and its proximity to the city-center. </p>

        <p> To delve deeper into our analysis, we can compare the results of the Food Inspection scores with the Yelp ratings. One could expect that a low Food Inspection score would also lead to a low Yelp rating, since customers would likely be prone to leaving a unhappy review if they fear the food is not safe. Surprisingly these two scores are not correlated. … </p>

        <h2 class="Title">Crimes</h2>

        <p> Chicago unfortunately does not only offer great food, but also suffers from a high criminality rate. However, the number of crimes per square kilometer in each community area varies greatly as can be seen in the map below. With almost 2’000 reported crimes in 2019 (until end of October), the popular Chicago Loop area has the highest overall crime density. It is however typical that the crime density is higher in the city centre as lots of people live, work and spend time in a relatively condensed area. Looking at the absolute numbers, it is however Austin, which has the lead with a total of 11’691 reported crimes (compared to 8’292 in Loop). Moreover, just looking at the mere total number of crimes does not inform us where the most violent crimes happen and which areas are really dangerous to go to. Indeed, when focusing on the violent crimes, the picture changes quite a bit: The city centre around the Loop area suffers less from very high violent crime rates, indicating that petty crime is disproportionately high in this area. However, community areas known to experience long-term socio-economic problems in the West Side, such as Garfield Park, Lawndale and Austin, also report higher violent crime rates. Similarly, some community areas in the South Side struggle with lots of cases involving violent crimes.
        </p>

        <p> One might not only be interested in the crimes of 2019 but the changes in the community areas over time in terms of criminal safety. The map below showcases the evolution of the crime density over the years from 2010 to 2018. We can observe that many areas shift to from very light colors (around the long-term average crime density) to darker blue-ish colors, indicating a reduction in overall crimes. At the same time, it is stunning to see how criminality increases gradually over time from 2015 to 2018 in the city center. This is consistent with the results observed before that the city center is currently the area with the highest overall crime density! </p>

        <h2 class="Title">Final</h2>

        <p> Are you looking for a good recommendation to eat some seafood with your family in Chicago? Or simply looking for a place to have coffee with a friend? The maps below will guide you in your choice, whilst allowing you to avoid food-poisoning and dangerous neighbourhoods. </p>

        <p> The scrollbar below allows you to interactively choose the Yelp rating the restaurant must have (1 or above, 2 or above, and so on). Only restaurants that reach this condition will appear on the map. In order to have the restaurants begin to appear on the map, you can now choose the types of restaurant foods you are interested in by hovering over the layer symbol. A long list of different types of foods (breakfast brunch, fast foods, Italian, etc.) will appear, and by ticking the food type, the desired restaurants will pop-up on the map. Large bubbles with numbers representing the number of restaurants with that food category in the area will appear, and by zooming in you can get a better look at the different types of restaurants. Indeed, by hovering on a unique restaurant, its name will appear. Then if you click on the restaurant pin, the Yelp rating along with the Food Inspection Score of the establishment will be presented. The Food Inspection Score gives you an idea of how food-safe the establishment is. A high Food Inspection Score (max. 10) means the best safety, and low (min. 0) is maybe an establishment that you could consider skipping if you don’t want to get sick...
        </p>

        <p> If you want to have an even safer experience in Chicago, not only in terms of the food safety, but also in terms of general safety, we’ve got you covered! The list containing the food categories also contains two supplementary categories named:  ‘Community areas crime’, and ‘Community areas names’. By ticking the former, the different communities of Chicago will be colored in different shades of green, in order to represent the crime density of each of the areas. For additional information on the community areas, the ‘Community areas names’ option will display the name of the community area when the mouse hovers above it. </p>
