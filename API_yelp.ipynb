    "This notebook is the one that had been used to scrapp the data from Yelp. As explained in our main notebook 'Descriptive Analysis', we wanted to add to our dataset the rates of the restaurants on the Yelp website. To be able to do this, Yelp provides an API which enables us to query the dataset.\n",

    "Yelp.com is a website that helps people find great local businesses such as restaurants based on customer reviews. Each business has a page where visitors can write comments and add a general grade reflecting their experience there. The Yelp fusion API enables us to access relevant information on restaurants such as their rating and their respective number of reviews. When trying to scrap the data, we first encountered an issue of how to uniquely identify each restaurant. Indeed, the Yelp API enables us to pass as an argument the latitude and longitude of all places we want to query. We initially thought that this will enable us to find the right businesses. However, the Yelp coordinates do not match exactly the ones of our dataset. Thus, quering by latitude/longitude didn't give us the right business (we generally obtained restaurants, which were closed to the one in which we were interested).\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we had to come up with another way to query our dataset. By looking at the API documentation on Yelp Fusion website, we found another function, called business_match_query, which enables us to give as argument the name and complete address of every restaurant. Trying this function on a few cases showed us that by doing this \"cross-research\", taking into account several pieces of information on the businesses, we obtain the right results. However, one disadvantage of this function is that the business_match_query doesn't enable us to access directly the Yelp reviews. But it gives us the Yelp ID, which is a unique identifier on Yelp website for a business. As a next step, we can use the requests package to access the reviews by giving it as an argument the Yelp ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, we were able to obtain the right results. One disadvantage of this method is the fact that we need to query the dataset twice. First to obtain the Yelp ID via the business_match_query function, and secondly to obtain the reviews using the ID. For this reason, we haven't queried our whole dataset yet. We should be able to have the full dataset ready before Wednesday (as Yelp restricts us to 5'000 queries per day).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the code of the scrapping, please refer to the file called API_yelp. In this file, we simply implemented the procedure explained above. Every day, we scrapped 2'500 rows of our dataset, then saved it as a csv file, and re-open this file the next day to continue the scrapping and so on (of course, we made some copies of it during the procedure to make sure to not lose any information)."
